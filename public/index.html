    <h1>Introduction to Networking</h1>
    
    <p>Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources and information. It plays a crucial role in today's connected world.</p>
    
    <p>Here are some key concepts in networking:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Every device on a network is assigned a unique IP address, which is used for identification and communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Router:</strong> A router is a network device that directs data traffic between different networks, such as your home network and the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>LAN and WAN:</strong> LAN (Local Area Network) refers to a network within a limited area, like your home or office, while WAN (Wide Area Network) covers larger geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> Networking relies on protocols like TCP/IP to govern how data is transmitted and received over a network.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Networking is a vast field with numerous subtopics, including wired and wireless networking, network security, and network administration.</p>
